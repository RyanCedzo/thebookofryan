## Introduction

Hey everyone :\) this is Ryan. This isn't an actual blog post, but I just finished successfully deploying my application after 
spending the last 6 hours working through the production build and deployment through Vercel and I am just so excited I am typing away
on my keyboard here. I don't really know what to say except that I'm so stoked. However, I want to type out a bit and get used to Markdown, so I'll
just keep typing away to myself and see what happens. If you don't care about my words, at least go check out my photo gallery and travel map. You made it this far already.
If you actually care about these rambled thoughts, then let's start with explaining what/why this website exists.

## 1.\) Why Am I Doing This?
I'd say I probably have 3 distinct reasons for this endeavor - Travel, Practice, and Introspection. Let's expand. 

#### 1.1 Travel
As anybody reading this would know, I love to travel. I've explored most corners of the US and regrettably not as many spots outside of the US as desired (just wait a year I'm telling ya), however still 
some wonderful spots. When paired with my incredibly terrible memory, I often find myself forgetting most of the places I travel to, especially the details and heartfelt moments. Some of this I capture and 
memorialize through Instagram and photos, but I've found that to be an increasingly ineffective method. How do I capture more than just photos? How do I authentically display the timeline of my life? Well,
this will be the experiment to see how well I can improve with a single URL.

#### 1.2 Practice
Let's hit on the second part of me - programming. Honestly, I mainly got into coding just because it provided me with a wonderful work/life balance and allowed me to remotely work and travel simultaneously.
However, this still means I need to keep my skills fresh and continue to learn in the field. I recently realized that I needed to improve on my Typescript skills at the same time I was also starting a project with
Next.js, so I figured the best way to improve my skills was to code a blog using Next.js and Typescript and here we are. I also decided to utilize Tailwind.css which I haven't actually utilized since the start of this project
yet. It is my hope that through this blog I will actually enjoy learning more about these skills in my field without it feeling like work. If there's one way to get better at a skill, it's to find a way to enjoy the 
practice. 

#### 1.3 Introspection
Woah. For once it actually IS that deep. For people that know me, they'd know that I tend to be a bit surface-level, writing off deeper context through an "it is what it is" attitude. Sure, it can be a good way to cope
through tough situations, but it doesn't lead to a very introspective life. I've gotten to the point where I want to make a more intentional effort towards looking deeper into life and understanding my own thoughts and actions
in deeper detail. That's just about as far as I have gotten. I just know that one way to start a habit is to just go for it and try to be consistent. This little website will help keep me accountable and I am hoping I will learn
a lot about myself in this experiment. I suppose I understand some of the hypocrisy that accompanies taking my own thoughts and putting them in a place others can see them and parading them as some form of introspection, but hey this is my blog
and I can do whatever I want. Even though I don't expect there to really be any readers to these words, imagining an audience as I type helps me to develop a unique voice; and I think that's pretty cool.

## 2.\) What is This?
I'll just take a quick second to go slightly into more detail on what this is. This website utilized a [Tailwind Next.js template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) that I then spent a lot of time adding functionality and styling to until it became something I liked. For starting out
projects, finding a good template is, in my opinion, a great way to not become discouraged and also save lots of time. Especially when it comes to coding, the starting is the most difficult part, as it usually takes an incredibly long time before you have something
that looks at all productive. Using a template helps provide more positive feedback earlier and keeps you encouraged to continue. The words I am writing are written in a markup language called Markdown. It allows for quick formatting of text
in documents and lots of functionality without needing complex formatting. The app itself is deployed on a platform called Vercel, which was surprisingly easy to use through my Github, which is where the code for this website is hosted. Through all of these languages, 
platforms, and code, this website is COMPLETELY FREE for me to create! Not having a cost barrier helps keep me going as well.

Now, this website is in its early infancy, but I figured if it was hosted and live, I would be more likely to actually put time into making it look better and start writing as well. It's worked so far I suppose, although there are probably plenty of issues and bugs that I still need to sort out. I also don't even have any posts other than this one?! I need to figure it out.
Well, some of the main features I have added so far include a photo gallery and a travel map. To all the phantoms I somehow believe are reading these words - go check them out! I plan to use this space to let my creativity go wild a bit, adding features and improving upon the current ones. The photo gallery could 
already use some more photos and I am in the process of adding data on each photo, such as location, camera, and date. My recent journey into film photography needed a place to live on this website. I also plan on possibly changing the map to account for more specific places.
I spent a few hours adding some of the most general locations on the map that I have traveled to within th past couple years and it is already starting to look bloated. How will I fit some of the specific spots on here without making a mess? That's a problem for future Ryan to solve
and I am going to enjoy whatever I come up with to design this map. Glacier and the Canadian Rockies are calling me for later this year and I would love to be able to add more specific places than just "Banff" and "Glacier National Park". 

## 3.\) What Will This Become?
Honestly, I don't have much of a clue other than just a place to throw my life at. I just wanted to have a place to keep track of travels, to throw words down and see the paragraphs they create. I've been pushing myself to journal more within the last year and even though I have seen some 
success with it, I have struggled to stay consistent. Maybe this whole thing is just my way of holding myself accountable. I already hinted at some of the changes I plan to make to the photo gallery and the travel map, but besides that, I may just let my mind run wild. I do however really intend
to try to dig deep every now and then and see what thoughts and opinions I come up with. This being said, I see myself breaking up blog posts into three main categories, The first category will just be travel posts which will just highlight specific parts of my travels. The second will be thoughts
and opinions - a place to try to understand myself better and to start to form more concrete opinions on anything. The last category will just be focused on ongoing projects or experiments. As I said earlier: this place is meant to be somewhere I can let my creativity flow. I am always trying out new little
experiments or projects that I would love to better document. Whether it is to discuss my sunset brackets or Spotify apps, I really would love to talk more about them to this empty gallery of people. Hey, this is already an improvement for me. I was able to sit down and write all these words out. 
I already consider that a success. If anybody actually read to here, I would be astounded. I have just been over here talking to myself as I type all of this pseudo-manifesto of sorts. I will continue to pretend I have an audience of readers as I find a unique voice from which to write. I just need 
to say I am so excited for what this space of mine becomes and already proud of myself for creating all of this from a single idea in my mind :\) 

P.S. If anybody is actually reading all of this and actually peruses my site and has ideas - please let me know.
